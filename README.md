An interactive music database RESTful MERN web app

Welcome to my first serious RESTful MERN web application!

You will be able to Create Read Update and Delete content (be it Bands, Albums or Tracks).
Register / login to your account to check additional features such as creating your own Playlist.
This RESTful API structure allows you to do basic CRUD operations.

Note: this application is not an example of perfect creation, as I am still at the beginning of my journey
in creating web apps with use of Node.JS + Express, MongoDB/MySQL and React.JS.

I hope this application is showing at least a decent practices in coding.

While the code is here to be displayed, you can also go and visit my application at:
